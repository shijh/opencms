Trouble Shooting
1. How to sign with gpg?
   See https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/How+To+Generate+PGP+Signatures+With+Maven

2. How to deploy to maven central?
   See https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

3. Cannot find gpg
   Link your gpg to /usr/bin/gpg.

4. My gpg signature cannot pass check in Sonatype's Nexus UI
   You have to create a "sign only" key and try again with the new key.
