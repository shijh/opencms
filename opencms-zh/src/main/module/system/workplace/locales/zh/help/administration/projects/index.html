In general you are working in the standard  projcect called &quot;Offline&quot;. This project implicitly includes all your available  pages and folders. Out of this project you are able to &quot;direct - publish&quot;  all your created or modified pages and folders. You may also publish the  complete offline project. But for larger websites this may publish more  resources than you might have control (or knowledge about their validity)  over.<br />
<br />
</span><span lang="DE-CH">Subprojects  allow to split the work on a&nbsp; website amongst several authors or to work on  different subparts independently. For instance you serve a standard site with  stable content. You often do minor changes like fixing writing errors or adding  some news. In a subproject you are able to add completely new parts that are  bigger and take longer to get stable. In this way it is possible to publish the  &quot;Offline&quot; project more frequently while having time to work on the bigger new  parts.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
